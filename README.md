<h2>Day 1: 15th August 2018</h2>
<h4>Todays Progress:</h4>
<p>Learnt how exactly gradient descent works with mathematical derivations and also learnt Naive bayes for classification and implemented using sklearn</p>
<h4>Thoughts:</h4>
<p>Gone crazy in mathematical proofs for gradient descent but very important to understand why we are doing everything and next sklearn is very easy to use.</p>
